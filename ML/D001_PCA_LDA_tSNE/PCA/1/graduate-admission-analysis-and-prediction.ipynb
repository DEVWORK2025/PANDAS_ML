With this kernel, students will guess their capacities and they will decide whether to apply for a master's degree or not.\n\n\nSo, basically this set is about the Graduate Admissions data i.e. Given a set of standardized scores like GRE, TOEFL, SOP standard scores, LOR standard scores, what is probability ( basically i have done a YES/NO scenario ) of gaining admission into a particular school. All those folks who are preparing for MS, might point out this question, from where did you get SOP & LOR scores. These aren’t public figures ? I mean yes, it might not be public, but dont you think universities might be grading these applications on some scale of rating so that the scores can be standardized. Hence the SOP, LOR scores.\n\n### Dataset\n\nThis dataset is created for prediction of graduate admissions and the dataset link is below:\n\n* Features in the dataset:\n\n* GRE Scores (290 to 340)\n\n* TOEFL Scores (92 to 120)\n\n* University Rating (1 to 5)\n\n* Statement of Purpose (1 to 5)\n\n* Letter of Recommendation Strength (1 to 5)\n\n* Undergraduate CGPA (6.8 to 9.92)\n\n* Research Experience (0 or 1)\n\n* Chance of Admit (0.34 to 0.97)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step1: Data Collection/ Data Extraction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Import Libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/Admission_Predict.csv\")\ndata.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.columns.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.drop('Serial No.', axis=1, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.rename({'Chance of Admit ': 'Chance of Admit', 'LOR ':'LOR'}, axis=1, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step 2:  Data Analysis or Data Exploration"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's see top 10 observation row and column wise\ndata.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's see the detail information of dataset\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## General statistics of the data\ndata.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Correlation coeffecients heatmap\nsns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True).set_title('Correlation Factors Heat Map', color='black', size='20')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### GRE Scores\n\nThe Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a the most popular test for graduate schools' admission, it consists of three sections : Analytical Writing, Verbal and Quantitative.\n\nThe test's maximum score is 340 and minimum is 260, and according to an official GRE score document, the mean test score for all individuals from July 1,2014 to June 30,2017 (almost 1,700,000 test taker) is 306.35 which rounds to 306 with an average standard deviation of 7.19\n\nsource: https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_interpreting_scores.pdf"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Isolating GRE Score data\nGRE = pd.DataFrame(data['GRE Score'])\nGRE.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The sample's GRE score mean is 316 which is a little bit higher than the mean mentioned previously (306)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# #
